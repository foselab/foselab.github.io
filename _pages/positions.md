The University of Bergamo has three open positions in computer science and computer engineering - related to software engineering.  

Bergamo is a small city, yet it is very rich in history and culture (see the recent article <https://www.ft.com/content/02497aca-c22d-431e-918f-011b91406ef1>). Salaries follow the rate fixed at the national level (details in the call). A tax benefit is provided to researchers coming from abroad. Additional personal funds are also offered on top of the salary, and several university calls for research funding can also support the researcher for traveling and research collaborations.  
___

## 1. Tenure-track faculty researcher position (RTT)

An RTT is the equivalent of an Assistant Professor position in the Italian system, and the promotion to Associate professor is automatically granted if the researcher obtains the national qualification (ASN). The position includes the possibility to apply for funding. The position is reserved for those who have not worked for the University of Bergamo in the last thirty-six months (details are in the call)

### Research program

The focus of the research activity will be on the use of computer science and engineering in all the domains. For instance, the research can operate on data management, machine learning, software engineering, or the design of secure computer systems.
The computer science group@UniBG (<https://cs.unibg.it/>) has research activities in the areas of databases, security, robotics, formal methods, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. 

### Teaching

The teaching activity will occur within the BSc and MSc programs, mainly in "Computer Science and Engineering". We have a new curriculum in Data Science and Data Engineering. The teaching load is 90 hours/year. Teaching is both in Italian and in English.

#### Deadline: 21st December 2023

___

## 2. Research Fellow (assegno di ricerca) PostDoc

The second position is for a PostDoc research fellow (PhD title is required - but if one is near the end, our university can wait a little till one gets the actual title - details are in the call). 

### Research program

The focus is on "Software Engineering Methodologies of Intelligent Autonomous Systems". Intelligent autonomous systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles of
software engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence to design, develop, and validate
systems that possess machine learning capabilities, adaptability, and decision-making autonomy.
The main objective of intelligent systems engineering is to establish the best processes for creating
and developing systems that can internally employ artificial intelligence components. This discipline
involves a series of activities ranging from the definition of system requirements and specifications,
to the choice of algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to be used, up to the realization and
practical implementation of the system and its validation. The project will explore innovative solutions
in different fields, focusing on a rigorous approach with strong methodological and formal
foundations. In conclusion, intelligent systems engineering is a discipline that aims to create
methodologies and techniques for the realization of autonomous, adaptive and intelligent systems.
This rapidly growing field offers ample opportunity for innovation and the application of advanced
technologies.

### Teaching

Teaching is not mandatory but if done it will contribute to increase the grant.

#### Deadline:  still to be decided (the call is still open)
___

## 3. Research Fellow (assegno di ricerca) Early Stage

The third position is for a research fellow (PhD title is NOT required to apply). The ideal candidate is a PhD student who is going to finish in the next few months his/her PhD course - but also students recently graduated at master level is fine.

### Research program

The focus is on "Trust assurance of Digital Twins for medical cyber-physical systems": The grant is funded by the PRIN project SAFEST. The goal of the project is to apply digital twin concepts to software engineering domain, with emphasis on software safety, adaptability, used in combination with formal methods, and for software certification and testing.

### Teaching

Teaching is not mandatory but if done it will contribute to increase the grant.
