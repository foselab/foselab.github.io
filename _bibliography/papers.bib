  abstract  = {Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) is a testing technique that has proved to be effective in finding faults due to the interaction among inputs, and in reducing the number of test cases. One of the most crucial parts of combinatorial testing is the test generation for which many tools and algorithms have been proposed in recent years, with different methodologies and performances. However, generating tests remains a complex procedure that can require a lot of effort (mainly time). Thus, in this paper, we present the tool pMEDICI which aims to reduce the test generation time by parallelizing the generation process and exploiting the recent multithread hardware architectures. It uses Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) for representing the constraints and the tuples to be tested and extracts from them the t-wise test cases. Our experiments confirm that our tool requires a shorter amount of time for generating combinatorial test suites, especially for complex models, with a lot of parameters and constraints.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel intensive therapy mechanical ventilator designed for rapid, large-scale, low-cost production for the COVID-19 pandemic. Free of moving mechanical parts and requiring only a source of compressed oxygen and medical air to operate, the MVM is designed to support the long-term invasive ventilation often required for COVID-19 patients and operates in pressure-regulated ventilation modes, which minimize the risk of furthering lung trauma. The MVM was extensively tested against ISO standards in the laboratory using a breathing simulator, with good agreement between input and measured breathing parameters and performing correctly in response to fault conditions and stability tests. The MVM has obtained Emergency Use Authorization by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and Health Canada Medical Device Authorization for Importation or Sale, under Interim Order for Use in Relation to COVID-19. Following these certifications, mass production is ongoing and distribution is under way in several countries. The MVM was designed, tested, prepared for certification, and mass produced in the space of a few months by a unique collaboration of respiratory healthcare professionals and experimental physicists, working with industrial partners, and is an excellent ventilator candidate for this pandemic anywhere in the world.},
