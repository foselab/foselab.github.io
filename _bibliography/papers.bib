  	abstract  = {Many researchers have been focusing on building combinatorial test generators having the best possible performances, in terms of smaller test suites and shorter generation times. The majority of tools generates test suites from scratch. This means that when the test suite must be regenerated, the old tests are discarded and a new test suite is built. However, there are many cases in which old test cases, possibly written by hand, need to be (or could be) included in the final test suite, and the test suite completed with new tests in order to reach the desired level of combinatorial coverage. These existing tests that are reused are generally called \emph{seed tests}. Seed tests could be important for testing domain-specific critical parts of the system, or they could represent old test suites that must be enriched to reach the desired (possibly higher) strength of coverage. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for incremental test generation that starts from existing test seeds. This new architecture is supported by the pMEDICI+ tool which extends our previous effort done for pMEDICI. We evaluate the proposed approach on the benchmarks given in the context of the second edition of the CT-Competition and w.r.t. two application scenarios. For each scenario, we automatically generate seed tests and then we apply pMEDICI+ to obtain the desired test suite. The experiments highlight that using incremental test generation can contribute significantly in the reduction of test generation time and, in many cases, in the reduction of the test suite size.},

	abstract="Using architectural patterns is of paramount importance for guaranteeing the correct functionality, maintainability and modularity, especially for complex software systems. The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern is typically used in user interfaces (UIs), since it allows the separation between the internal representation of the information and the way it is shown to users. The main problem of using this approach in a formal setting, where formal models are used to specify the requirements and prove safety properties, is that those models are not directly used within the MVC pattern and, thus, all the activities performed at model-level are somehow lost when implementing the UI. For this reason, in this paper, we present the formal MVC pattern (fMVC), an extension of the classical MVC where the model is a formal specification, written using Abstract State Machines. This pattern is supported by the AsmetaFMVCLib, which allows the user to link the formal model with the view and the controller by using simple Java annotations. We present the application of fMVC on a simple example of a calculator for explanatory purposes, then we apply it to the AMAN case study, which has inspired the definition of fMVC. We discuss the advantages of fMVC and its shortcomings, trying to identify the scenarios where it should be applied and possible alternatives.",

	abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are used for representing a variety of highly configurable systems or families of systems. They are commonly represented by feature models (FMs). Starting from FMs, configurations, used as test cases, can be generated to identify the products of interest for further activities. As the other types of software, SPLs and their FMs may evolve due to changing requirements or bug-fixing. However, no guidance is usually given on what to do with derived configurations when an FM evolves. The common approach is based on generating all configurations from scratch, which is not optimal since a greater effort is required for concretizing the new tests, and some of the old ones may be still applicable. In this paper, we present the use of a technique for generating combinatorial tests for evolving feature models: this technique incrementally builds the new combinatorial configuration set starting from the one generated from the previous model. Furthermore, we present a novel definition of dissimilarity among configuration sets that can be used to evaluate how much an evolved test suite differs from the previous one and thus allows evaluating the effort required for adapting old test cases to the new ones. Our experiments confirm that using the proposed technique, in general, leads to lower dissimilarity and test suite size w.r.t. the generation of tests from scratch.}

However, in the validation process, the nondeterminism is a hindrance in their application, as it can lead to flaky tests or flaky scenarios. Scenarios written for models that implement nondeterminism produce unpredictable outcomes by complicating model validation and reducing developer confidence. In this paper, we present an approach to address the nondeterminism in the validation phase when using the Asmeta framework. We extend the Avalla language, used for scenario specification in Asmeta, to allow deterministic control over nondeterministic choices. This extension ensures that scenarios written for nondeterministic models execute predictably by eliminating flakiness. We demonstrate our approach using a running example of an automatic coffee vending machine.},

Ensuring the safety of these complex systems is a major open challenge and requires robust mechanisms to enforce correct behavior during runtime. This paper illustrates a run-time safety enforcement framework for the output sanitization of an autonomous driving agent on a highway. The enforcement mechanism is based on a (formally validated and verified) Asmeta model representing the enforcement rules and used at run-time to eventually steer the driving agent to behave safely and avoid collisions. We demonstrate both efficacy and efficiency of the proposed enforcement approach by conducting an experimental evaluation. We connected our safety enforcer with the highway simulation environment and co-executed it with the pre-trained (unsafe) AI agents as provided by the ABZ 2025 case study. We consider the single-lane case with the safety requirement and one scenario of the multi-lane case about preferring the right-most lane},

The process follows these steps: (1) model the system as an abstract state machine; (2) validate and verify the model; (3) generate test sequences automatically from the ASM model; (4) execute the tests over the implementation and compute the code coverage; (5) if the coverage is below the desired threshold, then refine the abstract state machine model to add the uncovered functionalities and return to step 2. We have applied the proposed approach in three case studies: a traffic light control system (TLCS), the IEEE 11073-20601 personal health device (PHD) protocol, and the mechanical ventilator Milano (MVM). By applying RATE, at each refinement level, we have increased code coverage and identified some faults or conformance errors for all the case studies. The fault detection capability of RATE has also been confirmed by mutation analysis, in which we have highlighted that, many mutants can be killed even by the most abstract models.},

In this paper we present an approach based on the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method. Starting from the model, validation and verification (V&V) techniques can be applied. Furthermore, by step-wise refinement, a final model can be obtained, which can be automatically translated to  code. The process is applied to the smart pill box case study. Starting from the ASM model, we generate  code for the Arduino platform after the application of V&V activities. Furthermore, we introduce regulation (IEC62304) and guidelines (FDA General Principles of Software Validation) that support the developer in medical software development.

As state-of-the-art, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most adopted techniques for image classification. Although they are proved to have optimal results, it is not clear what happens when unforeseen modifications during the image acquisition and elaboration occur. Thus, it is very important to assess the robustness of a CNN, especially when it is used in a safety critical system, as, e.g., in the medical domain or in automated driving systems. Most of the analyses made about the robustness of CNNs are focused on adversarial examples which are created by exploiting the CNN internal structure; however, these are not the only problems we can encounter with CNNs and, moreover, they may be unlikely in some fields. This is why, in this paper, we focus on the robustness analysis when plausible alterations caused by an error during the acquisition of the input images occur. We give a novel definition of robustness w.r.t. possible input alterations for a CNN and we propose a framework to compute it. Moreover, we analyse four methods (data augmentation, limited data augmentation, network parallelization, and limited network parallelization) which can be used to improve the robustness of a CNN for image classification. Analyses are conducted over a dataset of histologic images.},

  abstract  = {Combinatorial Interaction Testing has been applied to event-driven software systems by using as test suite a set of sequences of inputs in desired combinations. This is generally called combinatorial sequence testing (CST). CST requires possibly new system models from which tests are generated and new test generation methods (or an adaptation of the classical ones). Finite State Machines (FSMs) can easily represent event-based systems where certain inputs are valid only in some states and such constraints can be represented by the incompleteness of the FSM. In this paper, we propose an approach to CST where tests are generated from FSMs which are represented by automata together with test requirements. First, automata can be used to check if test sequences contain invalid inputs. We propose three methods to repair tests with invalid inputs. Moreover, we can directly embed into automata the system constraints over the inputs during generations, to generate only valid test sequences. We compare our automata-based method with the standard approach of Sequences Covering Arrays (SCAs) that produces a set of sequences, all with the same length, composed by the permutation of all the events supported by the system. We found that generating only valid tests from automata provides several advantages iv.r.t. repairing tests and SCAs.},

We recently proposed a robustness definition that considers input data degraded by alterations that may occur in reality; the approach was originally devised for image classification in the medical domain. In this paper, we extend the definition of robustness to any type of input for which some alterations can be defined. Then, we present ROBY, a tool for ROBustness analYsis of ANNs. The tool accepts different types of data (images, sounds, text, etc.) stored either locally or on Google Drive. The user can use some alterations provided by the tool, or define their own.

  abstract  = {New tools for combinatorial test generation are proposed every year. However, different generators may have different performances on different models, in terms of the number of tests produced and generation time, so the choice of which generator has to be used can be challenging. Classical comparison between CIT generators considers only the number of tests composing the test suite. Still, especially when the time dedicated to testing activity is limited, generation time can be determinant. Thus, we propose a benchmarking framework including 1) a set of generic benchmark models, 2) an interface to easily integrate new generators, 3) methods to benchmark each generator against the others and to check validity and completeness. We have tested the proposed environment using five different generators (ACTS, CAgen, CASA, Medici, and PICT), comparing the obtained results in terms of the number of test cases and generation times, errors, completeness, and validity. Finally, we propose a CIT competition, between combinatorial generators, based on our framework.},

  abstract  = {Safety-critical systems require development methods and processes that lead to provably correct systems in order to prevent catastrophic consequences due to system failure or unsafe operation. The use of models and formal analysis techniques is highly demanded both at design-time, to guarantee safety and other desired qualities already at the early stages of the system development, and at runtime, to address requirements assurance during the system operational stage. In this paper, we present the modeling features and analysis techniques supported by ASMETA (ASM mETAmodeling), a set of tools for the Abstract State Machines formal method. We show how the modeling and analysis approaches in ASMETA can be used during the design, development, and operation phases of the assurance process for safety-critical systems, and we illustrate the advantages of integrated use of tools as that provided by ASMETA.},

In particular, in the latest years, the focus of validation has been put on assessing the robustness of CNNs, i.e., their ability to correctly classify perturbed input data. A way to measure robustness is to check the network accuracy over many datasets obtained by altering the input data in different ways, but this is time and resource-consuming. In this paper, we present ASAP, a method to efficiently compute the robustness of a CNN, exploiting a parabola-based approximation which allows to adaptively select only relevant alteration levels. The method is tested on two different benchmarks (MNIST and breast cancer classification). Moreover, we compare ASAP with other techniques based on uniform sampling, numerical integration, and random sampling.},

  abstract  = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers all over the world have offered their time and competencies to face the heavy consequences of the disease. This is the case of a group of physicists, engineers, and physicians that around the middle of March 2020 started to develop a simplified mechanical lung ventilator, called MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano), to answer the high request of ventilators for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units. A prototype was ready in around one month. Since medical software malfunctions can lead to injuries or death of patients, before marketing MVM ventilators and distributing them in hospitals, software certification in accordance with the IEC 62304 standard was mandatory to guarantee system reliability. The team was then complemented by computer scientists specifically devoted to this task. The software re-engineering process, which lasted around two months from the end of the prototype, brought to a strong re-implementation of the device software components, which involved all the stakeholders in a continuous integration setting. In this paper, we report the experience of the MVM control SW re-engineering necessary to show evidence that the SW adheres to the standards and to consequently obtain the certification. We share results and lessons learned from this social project, where more than 100 volunteer researchers worked towards software certification at the extreme of their strength to get a real device finished in a rush since strongly required to support physicians in treating COVID-19 patients.},

  abstract     = {Rigorous development processes aim to be effective in developing critical systems, especially if failures can have catastrophic consequences for humans and the environment. Such processes generally rely on formal methods, which can guarantee, thanks to their mathematical foundation, model preciseness, and properties assurance. However, they are rarely adopted in practice. In this paper, we report our experience in using the Abstract State Machine formal method and the ASMETA framework in developing a prototype of the control software of the MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano), a mechanical lung ventilator that has been designed, successfully certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to time constraints and lack of skills, no formal method was applied for the MVM project. However, we here want to assess the feasibility of developing (part of) the ventilator by using a formal method-based approach. Our development process starts from a high-level formal specification of the system to describe the MVM main operation modes. Then, through a sequence of refined models, all the other requirements are captured, up to a level in which a C++ implementation of a prototype of the MVM controller is automatically generated from the model, and tested. Along the process, at each refinement level, different model validation and verification activities are performed, and each refined model is proved to be a correct refinement of the previous level. By means of the MVM case study, we evaluate the effectiveness and usability of our formal approach.},

Free of moving mechanical parts and requiring only a source of compressed oxygen and medical air to operate, the MVM is designed to support the long-term invasive ventilation often required for COVID-19 patients and operates in pressure-regulated ventilation modes, which minimize the risk of furthering lung trauma. The MVM was extensively tested against ISO standards in the laboratory using a breathing simulator, with good agreement between input and measured breathing parameters and performing correctly in response to fault conditions and stability tests. The MVM has obtained Emergency Use Authorization by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and Health Canada Medical Device Authorization for Importation or Sale, under Interim Order for Use in Relation to COVID-19. Following these certifications, mass production is ongoing and distribution is under way in several countries. The MVM was designed, tested, prepared for certification, and mass produced in the space of a few months by a unique collaboration of respiratory healthcare professionals and experimental physicists, working with industrial partners, and is an excellent ventilator candidate for this pandemic anywhere in the world.},

  abstract  = {Neural networks have been widely applied for performing tasks in critical domains, such as, for example, the medical domain; their robustness is, therefore, important to be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a robustness definition for neural networks used for regression, by tackling some of the problems of existing robustness definitions. First of all, by following recent works done for classification problems, we propose to define the robustness of networks used for regression w.r.t. alterations of their input data that can happen in reality. Since different alteration levels are not always equally probable, the robustness definition is parameterized with the probability distribution of the alterations. The error done by this type of networks is quantifiable as the difference between the estimated value and the expected value; since not all the errors are equally critical, the robustness definition is also parameterized with a “tolerance” function that specifies how the error is tolerated. The current work has been motivated by the collaboration with the industrial partner that has implemented a medical sensor employing a Multilayer Perceptron for the estimation of the blood oxygen pressure. After having computed the robustness for the case study, we have successfully applied three techniques to improve the network robustness: data augmentation with recombined data, data augmentation with altered data, and incremental learning. All the techniques have proved to contribute to increasing the robustness, though in different ways.},

One of the most crucial parts of combinatorial testing is the test generation for which many tools and algorithms have been proposed in recent years, with different methodologies and performances. However, generating tests remains a complex procedure that can require a lot of effort (mainly time). Thus, in this paper, we present the tool pMEDICI which aims to reduce the test generation time by parallelizing the generation process and exploiting the recent multithread hardware architectures. It uses Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) for representing the constraints and the tuples to be tested and extracts from them the t-wise test cases. Our experiments confirm that our tool requires a shorter amount of time for generating combinatorial test suites, especially for complex models, with a lot of parameters and constraints.},

  abstract  = {Context:
During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, an international and heterogeneous team of scientists collaborated on a social project to produce a mechanical ventilator for intensive care units (MVM). MVM has been conceived to be produced and used also in poor countries: it is open-source, no patents, cheap, and can be produced with materials that are easy to retrieve.

Objective:
The objective of this work is to extract from the experience of the MVM development and software certification a set of lessons learned and then guidelines that can help developers to produce safety-critical devices in similar emergency situations.

Method:
We conducted a case study. We had full access to source code, comments on code, change requests, test reports, every deliverable (60 in total) produced for the software certification (safety concepts, requirements specifications, architecture and design, testing activities, etc.), notes, whiteboard sketches, emails, etc. We validated both lessons learned and guidelines with experts.

Findings:
We contribute a set of validated lessons learned and a set of validated guidelines, together with a discussion of benefits and risks of each guideline.

Conclusion:
In this work we share our experience in certifying software for healthcare devices produced under emergency, i.e. with strict and pressing time constraints and with the difficulty of establishing a heterogeneous development team made of volunteers. We believe that the guidelines will help engineers during the development of critical software under emergency.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present an approach to conformance testing based on abstract state machines (ASMs) that combines model refinement and test execution (RATE) and its application to three case studies. The RATE approach consists in generating test sequences from ASMs and checking the conformance between code and models in multiple iterations. The process follows these steps: (1) model the system as an abstract state machine; (2) validate and verify the model; (3) generate test sequences automatically from the ASM model; (4) execute the tests over the implementation and compute the code coverage; (5) if the coverage is below the desired threshold, then refine the abstract state machine model to add the uncovered functionalities and return to step 2. We have applied the proposed approach in three case studies: a traffic light control system (TLCS), the IEEE 11073-20601 personal health device (PHD) protocol, and the mechanical ventilator Milano (MVM). By applying RATE, at each refinement level, we have increased code coverage and identified some faults or conformance errors for all the case studies. The fault detection capability of RATE has also been confirmed by mutation analysis, in which we have highlighted that, many mutants can be killed even by the most abstract models.},
